# Roadbound 401
A knockoff of Crossy Road with special features like power-ups and the ability to destroy incoming trains. (Submitted as our ICS3U Final Project)
Through this project, we learned more about OOP and how to create a game that goes on infinitely with continuous random row generation that didn't create extra lag in the game.
We also had to teach ourselves a lot about displaying graphics in Java with JFrames and sprites, as well as incorporating background music and special effects audio.

The files were too large for GitHub so if you want to play this game with the audio files, please download them from [this Google Drive folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1CtNfG0nf8F7P5LyUtD3o2JBdBj_UxFHP?usp=sharing).

To play on your own device, download all the code and run StartingFrameOOP.java. More instructions and rules can be found within the game. 
Definitely not the most polished project but I hope you can still have fun playing!

Here is a short demo video showing basic gameplay componente (especially highlighting the features not in Crossy Road)
